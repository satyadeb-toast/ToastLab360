# ToastLab360: Empowering Remote Testing

ToastLab360 is an idea to establish a Robust In-House Lab for testing Toast Android hardwares remotely.

## Setup
In our Device Lab Infrastructure, we are harnessing the power of remote access and management through the use of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). This setup allows multiple users to connect to a central server, which, in turn, enables them to control and monitor a multitude of Toast Android devices within/outside the lab. 

Here's how it works:
- Lab Administrator: The Lab Administrator oversees the entire setup. They have the capability to manage devices and monitor the network from a central location.
- Network Router: The Network Router serves as a vital component in controlling access and ensuring the security of the infrastructure. It acts as a bridge, enabling data flow between the remote users and the central server.
- Server (Windows + Linux Machine): This central server is the heart of the infrastructure, allowing remote users to access it using RDP. The server handles test execution and data monitoring. Multiple users can log in concurrently.
- Android Devices: The Android Devices in the lab represent the Toast Android devices for testing. These devices are accessible and controllable through the central server.

Each RDP login is associated with specific users and their corresponding login credentials. Notably, each user can be connected to one or more Android devices, allowing for efficient and concurrent testing. This setup optimizes the management of the lab's resources, enhances productivity, and streamlines the testing process. It's an innovative solution for collaborative and remote device management, ensuring that your lab operates efficiently and effectively.
